## Project: Rock Paper Scissors / The Odin Project 
<br>

## Summary ##

In this project, I created the game 'Rock Paper Scissors' to practice writing a Javascript program from scratch. The project is divided into two parts. <br>
The first phase is to enable the game to be played from the browser console, as described [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors). <br>
The second phase involves adding UI to play from the website browser, as described [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors).
